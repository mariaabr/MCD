Questions for SOM:
Q1: What is the numeric criteria that you may use to determine if a change in the algorithm produces improvements?



Q2: Write the version SOM1A, where you change the curve of the learning factor. Did you achieve improvements?



Q3: Write the version SOM1B, where you change the curve of the deviation. Did you achieve improvements?



Q4: Write the version SOM1C, where you change the change the normal distribution to other distribution of your choice. Did you achieve improvements?



Q5*: Determine the mathematical conditions that ensure the convergence of equation (3) in page 14 of this slides.



Q6: As explained in class, SOM can be seen as a Euler integration method for the corresponding ODE. Estimate the absolute error after N epochs.



Q7*: How could you change the SOM method to use Runge-Kutta second order method? Is the improvements?



Q8*: Estimate the absolute error after N epochs by using Q7.



Q9: How would you combine the answers to Q1-Q8, in order to suggest an improved version?
